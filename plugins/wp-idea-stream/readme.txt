== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm not using BuddyPress, will it work without it ? =
Of course! But try BuddyPress, it's awesome :)

= I'm not using WordPress 3.9, is this plugin compatible with an older version ? =
Version 1.2 of the plugin requires WordPress 3.9, if you want to use this plugin with an earlier version of WordPress, you'll need to download a previous version of the plugin.
I advise you to browse the [different versions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-idea-stream/developers/ "Other version") available and choose version 1.0.3 if you run a WordPress from 3.1 to 3.4.2 and 1.1 if you run a WordPress from 3.5.
