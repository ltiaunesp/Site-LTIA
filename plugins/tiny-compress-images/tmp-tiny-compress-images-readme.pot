#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "After you upload an image to your WordPress site, each resized image is uploaded to the TinyJPG or TinyPNG service. Your image is analyzed to apply the best possible compression. Based on the content of your image an optimal strategy is chosen. The result is sent back to your WordPress site and will replace the original image with one smaller in size. On average JPEG images are compressed by 40-60% and PNG images by 50-80% without visible loss in quality. Your website will load faster for your visitors, and you’ll save storage space and bandwidth!"

msgid "Install this plugin and obtain your free API key from https://tinypng.com/developers. With a free account you can compress roughly 100 images each month (based on a regular WordPress installation). The exact number depends on the number of thumbnail sizes you use. You can change which of the generated thumbnail sizes should be compressed, because each one of them counts as a compression. And if you’re a heavy user, you can compress more images for a small additional fee per image."
